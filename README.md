This repo is to demonstrate what the Action at a Distance anti-pattern can look like. So, please, don't fix the problem. :)

## A blog post discussing this code and Action at a Distance anti-pattern
I've written a blog post discussing this code and the action at a distance anti-pattern. The [blog post is here](https://rodathome.wordpress.com/2020/02/22/the-action-at-a-distance-anti-pattern/)

## .NET Framework used
This is written using .NET Framework 4.7.2. I believe I wrote it using that framework because of the MVVM Light framework we used at work, which hasn't been upgraded in several years.

## Upgraded the project to .NET 7
Recently I updated the project to .NET 7.
